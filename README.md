# Cinema Room REST Service

## Description
This repository is my answer to the Cinema Room REST Service challenge at Hyperskill. The code is just one way of answering the questions, stages and challenges the lab requires. I do not own the rights to the Lab itself, but I do represent a way of solving the stages.

## Task 1 objective
Let's make our virtual movie theater with the help of a REST service. Our movie theater has 9 rows with 9 seats each. In this stage, you need to create a simple endpoint that will return the information about the cinema in JSON format.

Implement the /seats endpoint that handles GET requests and returns the information about the movie theatre.

The response should contain information about the rows, columns, and available seats. The response is a JSON object.
